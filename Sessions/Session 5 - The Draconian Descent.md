## Recap from the Previous Session

![[Session 4#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

### Evacuation Underway

The town is loud with all of the movement going on with getting ready to leave, packing, prepping boats, etc. [[Vogler]] is boarding people now and most of us are helping in any way we can. 

>[!info] Lending a helping Hand
>Grumm helps out a family and gives the kid, Javi, a doll.

As all of this is going on, the hooded figures finally descent into the town...

### A series of battles

At this point, it is simply battle after battle- we are trying to fend of the hooden figures, help the military, evacuate the citizens, etc. 

A couple of things to note - 
1. One of the hooded figures says something in "draconian" to [[Weisslogia]]... but [[Weisslogia]] couldn't quite make out the language exactly. Seemed to be a variation/dialect on true draconian. 
2. [[Elerion Windwalker]] keeps seeing images/visions when throwing wood into a fire.

After multiple battles in which a couple of us almost fell... we are finally attempting to make it back to one of the ships before the rest of the army or worse....catches up to us. 

P.S. Took this many sessions for Grumm to realize he was playing with a pretty big handicap...

## Session Summary

### Planning for an Ambush

As soon as we took notice of the 4 soldiers, we knew it meant trouble; if we didn't do anything now, we might not give our towns people enough time to evacuate. 

We quickly formulated a plan that involved splitting up into 2 groups and attempting to defeat the 4 soldiers and the messenger on the horse here and now, before they had a chance of escaping and alerting their bigger army. The plan was for Sylvanas ([[Weisslogia]]) to cast a sleep spell to see if we can knock any soldiers unconscious while concurrently [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] and [[Durin Son of Ingras]] attacked and ambush the messenger. 

### The Attack

[[Weisslogia]]'s sleep spell manages to only affect 1 of the 4 soldiers - which was still a great help - one less to worry about! [[Elerion Windwalker]] and [[Xidon]] also launch forward along with [[Weisslogia]] via a catapult engineered together by [[Frostwind]] across the ridge. 

[[Grumm Stonebreaker]] lunges himself down to the messenger on the horse in efforts of preventing him from escaping and alerting others while [[Durin Son of Ingras]] took aim with his arrows from above, covering for [[Grumm Stonebreaker]]. 

### Taken Prisoners

Eventually, 3 of the 4 soldiers are taken prisoners - [[Weisslogia]] accidentally burns up one of the soldiers, while the messenger is also taken prisoner. [[Xidon]] starts to question them as soon as possible about their plans before the rest of the army takes note of their absence. They go on and on about their dragon queen being here. The paladine dragon is mentioned, which take great disgust at. 

While all this is going on [[Weisslogia]] knows very well what the dragon queen, the chromatic dragon, is capable off and starts to slowly develop more courage not just on the battle field but as a person. He knows he will have to if he plans on defeating not just the dragon queen, but his father - [[Ymrynth]] - a fearsome leader of an elite squad of dragonborne in service to the queen. 

Each of the prisoners seem to have a glowing red crystal in their chest that when grabbed (which [[Weisslogia]] did) they seem to grow in pain. Additionally, [[Weisslogia]] seemed to have also felt some warmth in the same place these soldiers had the crystal in...

### Making an Escape

After deciding to spare the lives of the prisoners and leaving them in a random house before heading out, a creature goes up to us with a hostage of his own and battle happens once again. [[Vogler]] goes on ahead saying her goodbyes to try and slow down the army....which wasn't by a lot. Although a quick finish, [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] begins to turn to stone...which is eventually resolved. 

We end the session with blowing up the gate entrance to try and slow down anyone from entering the town as much as possible, as we make our way back to the docks to see if we are ready to evacuate yet.

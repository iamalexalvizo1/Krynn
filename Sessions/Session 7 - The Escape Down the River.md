## Recap from the Previous Session

![[Session 6 - The Boilerdrak and The Fewmaster#Session Summary]]


## Session Summary

After the last few battles, everything around is set ablaze...the fire is reaching the docks, corpses of draconian scatter the village. [[Raven Uth Volger]] is preparing the last couple of boats and yells out for us to get in the boat. 

As we are making out way to the boat [[Jeyev]] makes his way over as well out of no where and we all start settling into the boat - though [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] falls. 

As we are loading into the boats...a huge red dragon flies over us and grabs [[Raven Uth Volger]] and throws him somewhere deep into the burning town. We also notice someone in black armor with flames in her left eye riding the dragon. After saying something... the dragon flies off. 

We eventually make it onto the boats and start riding down the river, which should lead us straight to [[Kalaman]], within a few hours. [[Jeyev]] gives a helmet to Darren on Becklins behalf. 

We all doze in and out while riding down the river. As we get closer to [[Kalaman]], we start asking [[Xidon]] some questions about how [[Kalaman]] is.

## Session Summary

![[A_Navarro_At_the_edge_of_a_lonely_clearing_deep_in_the_Kalam_232669cb-8389-459a-9a2c-67dbb7181f33.png]]

We find ourselves on horseback going back to Kalaman, Xidon is holding onto a scroll that he received from scouts from Melgar - asking for help from Kalaman.  

Kael attempts to break the seal and take a peek at what the letter is saying...

> In accordance with Maelgoth-Kalaman alliance, Maelgoth requests Kalaman military aid in its war against the Blue Dragon Army. Enemy forces will likely arrive at our walls within next half year. Our citizens' safety is in your hands. Vorthalith is knocking, claiming partnership with Kansaldi

This of course is surprising a couple of ways...The party has not heard of the "blue dragon army", only the "red" one. Additionally, the name "Volrthalith" brings great alarm to [[Weisslogia]]...that is his father. 

We eventually take the scroll back to [[Marshal Vendris]] and take 200 gold each for this mission! We also level up! We now find ourselves at level 5! At this point, there is an armory made available to us in which Kael and Xidon let me borrow each about 200 gold (I already paid Kael 100 gd) so that I can buy an upgraded great axe ðŸª“. 

We are once again sent on an urgent mission to check up on some scouts for [[Marshal Vendris]]...fearing that they might be dead. We take a short rest for the night and make our way through the trade gate (as opposed to the war gate).

After about 15 miles, we  arrive at the scene where there are a couple of bodies...and we are attacked by psuedo-drakes! After making quick work of them, we verify these are in fact the scouts...now dead. 

We take notice during the battle with the pseudo-drakes that there is an army approaching from the north...after closer examination...it is the red dragon army being led by a golden dragon looking figure. They are now within 150ft from us...

Seeing that we are greatly outnumbered, we grab the bodies and start rushing south...where we find another army approaching...[[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]] shows up to our surprise. After a rushed surprise and greeting, we informed her of what is coming and she commands a few soldiers to hold them off as best as they can while we make our escape. 

[[Weisslogia]], being of great intelligence uses his Greenshield ring to create an alarming sound that only the golden dragon is able to hear...rendering him confused as well as some of his dragonborne soldiers...

We made our escape...for now.

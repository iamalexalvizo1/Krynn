## Session Summary

As we make our way closer to the docks. Suddenly, the group hears screams from up ahead. Fire and smoke is everywhere when suddenly people are heard screaming “DRAGON!!!”. A black creature is seen with smoke coming from its mouth and crackling flames. With the dragon, a group of Draconians.

The group begins to fight against the dragon and Draconians. Towards the middle of the fight, [[Elerion Windwalker]] and [[Silvanas]] recognize that the dragon is not a real dragon, but a mechanical dragon operated by two Draconians. They all appear to be led by a Bozak draconian. 

[[Grumm Stonebreaker]], being on the front line, is first in line to be fried by the mechanical dragon. Miraculously, he dodges a burst of flames released by the mechanical beast's mouth. He knows for sure he would have been burned to a crisp if he didn’t move quickly (ONE SHOTTED per DM lol). The group continues to fight until almost all the Draconians are dead. [[Grumm Stonebreaker]], running high on adrenaline, engages the Bozak and, in an amazing combo, cuts off the Bozak’s wings and, with a final 360 spin, cuts off his head. 

Suddenly, a noise can be heard coming from the brass crab. Out bursts a giant ogre [[Fewmaster]] who leads several more Draconians. Enter battle again.

[[Xidon]], who had become aware that the dragon was mechanical, rushes to operate the machine. He turns the contraption to hit as many enemies as he can. He sets fire and out bursts more deadly flames. It hits a Baaz Draconian and he is immediately incinerated. The flame also hits the [[Fewmaster]], however, he’s not so easily defeated. Enraged, he charges towards [[Xidon]] and begins to pummel him. Not to be outdone, a second Bozak appears and goes for multiple lightning strikes toward [[Xidon]] as well as [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] and [[Elerion Windwalker]] who are nearby. 

From a distance, we can hear the townspeople cheering us on from their boats as they are escaping the town. This encourages the group to continue the fight against the invaders. 

[[Xidon]], getting absolutely clapped by the [[Fewmaster]] and Bozak is near death when suddenly [[Durin Son of Ingras]] gives him a burst of healing and [[Xidon]] is able to cling to life. [[Durin Son of Ingras]], having been sending a barrage of attacks from a distance the whole fight, eventually lands a killing blow on the [[Fewmaster]]. From there, the team is able to finish the fight against this group of Draconians

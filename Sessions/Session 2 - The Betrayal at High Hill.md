## Session 2 Summary
![[battle.png| 500]]

### In the Midst of Battle

We open the scene with blood and bodies everywhere. In our case, we are engaged by 3 mercenaries. 

We easily defeat these mercenaries, although their war horses prove to be worthy adversaries! Eventually, [[Gragonis]], a huge guy with a devastatingly huge battle axe joins the battle with a small group of his own mercenaries. 

>[!info] Injured Memeber Joins the Fight
>At some point, there is an injured member of the Vogler militia that cuts in, trying to escape one of the mercenaries, which we end up saving!

As the battle grows, the mercenaries quickly realize that some of us are in fact strong. Although [[Weisslogia]] is careful to not use any dragon specific skills, his brute strength is noticed by [[Gragonis]] as he blocks heavy hits and lands his own punishingly strong attacks. 

>[!error] Magic Shenanigans
>Something to note is that a few of us used magic...which is very very out of the ordinary in this land. 

Eventually, the battle ends, with victory on our side. There were no mercenary survivors (on this battle field at least).

>[!warning] Level Up!
>We are now level 3!

### After the Battle

As things settle down, [[Durin Son of Ingras]] searches the bodies of the fallen mercernaries, and finds a letter on [[Gragonis]] 

>[!tip] Letter
>a letter mentioning a [[Kansaldi]], that she will be showing up and expects things done

[[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]] is standing next to [[Becklin Uth Viharin]], on the verge of tears. 

As we are trying to find out what and why this happened, [[Xidon]] engages in conversation with [[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]]. Cudgel mentions that "this wasn't supposed to happen". She also points out that [[Gragonis]] was second in command, along with [[Jeyev]], who is not here. Additionally, many more of her mercenaries are not here....

### Back at [[Brass Crab]]

Everyone huddles around the big table...with [[Raven Uth Volger]] at the end of it, attempting to access what happened and next steps. It is obvious that [[Cudgel]] was betrayed and than many more mercenaries are going to be attacking soon...

[[Svilnt Sunderlit]] is a surviving mercenary that was caught for questioning, although there is not a lot that he says. [[Weisslogia]] uses his channel divinity that enhances his persuaion...which doesn't help. [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] alludes to torture, which doesn't help. Eventually, [[Durin Son of Ingras]] offers gold and he speaks up...

He mentions the following - 

- [[Gragonis]] goes into the woods and comes back with A LOT of gold
- goal to weaken [[Vogler]]
- gathered mercenaries that are loyal to the coin
- [[Jeyev]] stayed back at the encampment (calls him a coward)

>[!info] Xidon Reacts
>[[Xidon]] becomes visibly disgusted at the situation.

Although [[Cudgel]] wants to go to the forest [[Svilnt Sunderlit]] mentions and the encampment NOW, the major advices against it and instead suggests to regroup for the night and ready ourselves to go in the morning. Reluctantly, [[Cudgel]] agrees (including taking [[Svilnt Sunderlit]] to a nearby shed...) and calls it a night. 

As Cudgel strides off, she begins to mention something...but then drops it. With a little push, she was wondering if we can help heal her deep wounds acquired in this last battle...

>[!note] Healing Cudgel
>As [[Weisslogia]], [[Xidon]], and [[Durin Son of Ingras]] heal her, we all feel her warmth as well. She thanks us for healing her. 

[[Grumm Stonebreaker]] seems a little taken aback at the healing and magic that is going on...and wants to find out more about it. 

[[Raven Uth Volger]] asks the party to stay and help them in the morning, which we agree to. [[Durin Son of Ingras]] only agreed after getting the nicest water facing room and complimentary beverages at the bar.

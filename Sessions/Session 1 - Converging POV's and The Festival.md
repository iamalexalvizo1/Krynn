## Session 1 Summary

>FInd a recording of the session [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvVccPyw0Y).

This is the session where all of POV's converged when we all met in [[Vogler]] at the [[Brass Crab]]. 

*Note - _Syd and Rafa did not make the session 😞_

### Catching up with Weisslogia

The campaign started with a quick aftermath of [[Weisslogia]] and him being saved by [[Drundi]]. He was unconscious for a few days while traveling to [[Vogler]]. He woke up, still aching and hurting from whatever happened by in [[Sylvanesti]]. [[Drundi]] informed him that [[Sylvanesti]] has fallen...

Drundi informed [[Weisslogia]] that he will be headed to the northern wastelands after dropping me off at [[Vogler]] and asked me to meet up with him and the rest of the caravan when I am able to - he could use my help. I mention something in draconic to him roughly translating to 

> forever comrades

### Durin's POV

[[Durin Son of Ingras]] is arriving by horse into the city of [[Vogler]]. As he is entering, he sees a really big hill, where apparently a battle took place long ago. A re-enactment will soon take place here as part of the big festival!

[[Durin Son of Ingras]] makes his way to the [[Brass Crab]] where arrangements have been made for him by [[Ispen Greenshield]]. In talking with [[Yalme]], the barkeep, Durin finds out that [[Rovino]] will be on the list - a big name!

### Converging POV's

Already sitting inside, [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] watched [[Durin Son of Ingras]] walk into the [[Brass Crab]], grab a drink, and lurk around trying to listen in on other's conversations. 

They both meet and talk about how they each met [[Ispen Greenshield]]! They have both known Ispin for most of their lives it turns out, even if they only see each other a few times a year. [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] talks about his home on the outskirts of [[Lemish]] while sharing a meal with [[Durin Son of Ingras]]. 

They begin talking about what they may or may not know of [[Rovino]] (which seems to be a high wizard of sorts that aids the king in [[Kalaman]]). [[gigas]], orange headed girl helping the bar keep brings over another round to Durin and Grumm and they decide to also buy [[Rovino]] a round. 

>[!warning] Grumm on the Alert
>[[Grumm Stonebreaker]] is suspicious of how safe the town is...even if he's told it is in fact safe. 

[[Xidon]] finds himself recovering from his injuries in the previous session ( [[Session 0.5 - World Building#Xidon]] ). [[gigas]] lets him know of the other folks here on Ispin's behalf and quickly joins their table and introduces himself. [[Xidon]] confides in [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] and [[Durin Son of Ingras]] about the lizard/dragon like creatures that attacked him...

[[Becklin Uth Viharin]] enters the [[Brass Crab]] at some point and announces for everyone to meet outside in 15 minutes for [[Ispen Greenshield]] funeral. 

>[!info] Becklin's Armor
>She's adorned in Salamnic armor with a Rose crest symbol of sorts

Eventually, [[Weisslogia]] walks over to the table where everyone else is sitting at and introduces himself as _Silvanas_, an elf from [[Sylvanesti]]. [[Xidon]] seems to be a little suspicious...

[[Durin Son of Ingras]] approaches [[Rovino]] and makes small talk about [[Ispen Greenshield]]. 

### Ispin's Funeral

Eventually, we all make our way outside where everyone is getting ready to lower [[Ispen Greenshield]] into the water to forever drift away.

>[!error] Missing Friends...
>[[Grumm Stonebreaker]] decided to take a nap instead of going outside. 

Speeches, music, and sadness is all around while we say goodbye to Ispin. 

We meet [[Darret Highwater]], [[Becklin Uth Viharin]]'s apprentice. [[Durin Son of Ingras]] makes conversation with him and asks what he may know about [[Rovino]]...which seems to tense him up a bit and says little to nothing about him. [[Durin Son of Ingras]] gets a bad feeling from this...

People tell stories of Ispin, raises drinks to him and try to have a good time! Though [[Lord Bakaris Jr]] seems to be acting out until he eventually storms off. 

[[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]] invites us all to participate in the re-enactment tomorrow...to which [[Weisslogia]] is very nervous about....

[[Becklin Uth Viharin]] and [[Xidon]] have a private conversation about some of the recent incidents around town...Becklin asks him to let us know to pay her a visit tomorrow - she has gifts for us. 

[[Weisslogia]] is the first to bid goodnight (still trying to make himself small not attract attention) and goes to bed. 

### The Next Day...

[[Darret Highwater]] invites us to the [[Fishbowl]] for some tasty treats! We promptly make our way over to the [[Thornwall Keep]], which is an old military base that has been repurpose into an office/home for [[Becklin Uth Viharin]]. [[Becklin Uth Viharin]] awaits us at the entrance...

[[Xidon]] and [[Becklin Uth Viharin]] have a private conversation first about the ongoing troubling events around the city and leave up with having [[Becklin Uth Viharin]] having to report to [[Kalaman]]. He then eventually calls us all in for gifts. 

[[Weisslogia]] is gifted a beautiful, very ornate green scaly shield; it is very clearly seen the hardships of time and battle, but the patina only adds to its beauty. 

>[!info] Ispin's Greenshield
>It is mentioned that although used and loved by Ispin, it is thought he never used it to it's full potential. Additionally, no one believes that the green scales on the shield are _real_ dragon scales. 

All of us also get a ring made from a broken pendant. 

### Trouble in the Festival

We make our way over to the festival and get in line for the fishing tournament! [[Lord Bakaris]] kept gluing himself to anyone that would catch the biggest fish and provide nothing but a distraction...

After a few rounds of fishing, [[Xidon]] is the winner by catching 11 ft worth of fish with [[Weisslogia]] winning 2nd place with 10.5 ft worth of fish!

>[!tip] Fishing Prizes
>[[Xidon]] wins a basket full of goodies from all the neighborhood shops.
>[[Weisslogia]] wins a ticket to redeem at any of shops.

We make our way to the big hill, gather equipment ([[Weisslogia]] mostly just wants to assure himself he won't be seen...even though he is leading the charge with the shield), and begin our re-enactment! 

As [[Weisslogia]] is leading the charge to this fake battle, he begins to blur the lines between past and preset and begins to muster up real courage with real fighting intents in this fake battle. Very quickly, however, [[Xidon]] noticed that the fake enemy is actually real and are carrying real weapons. He stops [[Weisslogia]] and informs the group... "those are real weapons...those are mercenaries".

### In comes Kael

In a dimly lit chamber of the castle, we find ourselves once again in the region of Kalaman, where a new face shows up - [[Kael]]. This elf is speaking with the governor about a problem the governor would like help with. Just south of the city, there is a brilliant gnome - [[Tatiana Rookledust]]; it seems her creations are being weaponized by the red dragon army and the governor wants to know if she is involved in treason somehow and if not, for her to join the forces against the red dragon army.

### At a difference part of the castle

The decision to help the governor looms over everyone, with everyone having a countenance of deep contemplation. [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] looks to [[Xidon]] on where they can possibly obtain more information about what seems to be inevitable. 

After mentioning [[Sister Reyna]], the group makes their way over to the orphanage where [[Xidon]] grew up. Behind the orphanage is a quant and modest pub where everyone meets [[Sister Reyna]]. [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] inquires about his hometown if she happens to know anything - she doesn't. 

Everyone at this point is conversing with someone else. [[Weisslogia]] speaks to [[Xidon]] about his thoughts on the governor, [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] speaks with [[Durin Son of Ingras]] about the possibility of joining this group a bit more willingly, and other tumult that naturally comes with the pub. 

### The Next Morning

After calling it a night and so graciously being provided bedding for the night at the orphanage, [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] and [[Weisslogia]] have a heart to heart and [[Weisslogia]] opens up to [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] about who and what he really is - [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] responds with a big bear hug. 

> [!info] Durin Lending a helping hand
> It is worth noting that while everyone else prepared to go to bed, Durin went back to all of the displaced Volgarians to inform them of the progress being made about their situation and to assure them the the governor has a plan for all of them

### Back at the Castle

We eventually make our way back to the castle where we meet [[Kael]] for the first time as well as hear the details of what the governor needs our aid in. After a meet and greet with [[Kael]] and agreeing to all work together to help the governor, we make our way to meet with [[Tatiana Rookledust]] for her to hopefully join our battle that seems to be coming to Kalaman soon enough. 

### Tatiana the Brilliant Gnome

As we make our way towards south of the city, [[Xidon]] seems to have been robbed of his gold that we have just received from the clerk at the castle. 

Because of the dangers looming, it takes us about 30 minutes on horseback to journey 12 miles - very expeditiously. 

>[!info] Stranger Danger?
>Along the way, there is a random person that stops us to inquire about the presence of dragons and if we know of them? Long story short...no, and we go our separate ways...but not before [[Kael]] was ocularly patting him down...

As we get to [[Tatiana Rookledust]]'s house, there is a small goblin militia trying to break down her door. 

### A Swift Battle

The battle took an auspicious turn when [[Durin Son of Ingras]] used his channel divinity, Radiance of the Dawn, to blast most of the goblins away! [[Weisslogia]] finished off what seemed to be the leader of the small group of goblins by thundering his battle axe down on the leader, creating a chasm - innards and blood pouring out. 

### The Aftermath

[[Kael]] interrogates one the only goblin that remains alive and gets confirmation that were hired by the Red Dragon Army to pick up some weapons and communication devices. The woman with the glowing eye paid good money for it.

[[Tatiana Rookledust]] graciously gives us 2 Fargab's (see picture above) and agrees to join the governor in our battle against the red dragon army. 

We begin making our way back...

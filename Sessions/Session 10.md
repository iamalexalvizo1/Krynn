## Recap from the Previous Session
![[Session 9#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

After the previous battle, we collect ourselves and head back to Kalaman on horseback. As we are riding back, a few of us notice a weird sign we hadn't seen before, a sign that seemed as if it was born from the earthy just recently. A few of us take Tatiana back to Kalaman while [[Xidon]], [[Kael]], and myself investigate the sign a bit further. 

Upon closer inspection, we see the sign says _Isolde's Concoctions and Ingrid's Fortunes_, which leads to a dense part of a forest. Eventually, we make our way through the thickness of the tress and land on a little cottage with smoke coming out from the chimney with a garden full of sweet smells (perhaps Lilacs?). 

We are greeted by a couple of unpleasant looking ladies, Isolde and Ingrid. Ingrid asks us if we want our fortunes told...which [[Xidon]] and [[Kael]] agree too, which I was a bit more hesitant. While we waited for preparations to be done, we went over to Isolde, the more reserved of the 2 sisters to see what sort of potions and elixirs she had available. After some discussion, we walked away with a strength potion, truth serum, and regular potions. 

> [!warning] Potions seem to good to be true
> We get the feeling that these potions are a bit volatile and perhaps not safe to use. When we made our way back to Kalaman, we had them checked out by someone there to which they said "they don't seem safe, I wouldn't use them".

Once preparations for the fortunes to be told were set, we made our way over. Ingrid started with her ceremonies, which involved some humming, a beetle, and the slamming of said beetle. She looks over at me with great unease and mentions that there is great danger coming and that only we (me) can put a stop to it. She also mentions that we need to _kill_ the governor of Kalaman...to which [[Xidon]] and myself were a bit more skeptical about. 

Eventually, we make it back to Kalaman and catch up with old friends from Vogler as well as our fellow party members. We make a report to [[Marshal Vendris]] (although we do not mention what the fortune teller said we must do to prevent a great calamity). 

[[Marshal Vendris]] informs us that some farmers made their way over to Kalaman to report that they were attacked by some kind of undead creatures...they only managed to escape because another knight of Solamnia saved them - [[Durstan RIal]]. But in his efforts to save the family, he might have gotten trapped there, our new mission - search and rescue. 

We make our way to our sleeping quarters since its late in the day and get some much needed rest. Though late during the night, [[Xidon]] is cleaning his armor. I couldn't sleep so I head over to the balcony to sit with [[Xidon]] for a while. We talk of many things...what we think of what the witches said, the governor, Tatiana. For the first time, [[Xidon]] sees me for who I really am - a dragonborne. I am not wearing my disguise so my claws, talons, white scales, horns teeth are all visible. I even take in a deep breath only to show the burning inner power within me (though I stop short of breathing fire out). I mention the stories my mother would tell me about what is considered fables to others...and their connection to me (though I never truly understand or believed what my mother said). 

The next morning, we pack and head over to the farmhouse only to find it badly burned, party in flames, with a few undead soldiers at the door, gnawing at it.

[[Xidon]] recognises the armor they wearing as Solamnic armor...though not recent. It is old, vintage Solamnic armor they wearing. 

We of course are victorious in battle and [[Durstan RIal]] comes out the front door. 

>[!info] An old Acquaintance
> [[Durstan RIal]] and [[Xidon]] know each other from the academy days. Xidon sasses him and pokes fun at his lack of ability. Xidon also notices that he seems to be nervous about something....

## Recap from the Previous Session

![[Session 2 - The Betrayal at High Hill#Session 2 Summary]]

## Session 2 Summary

### Xidon Meets Frostwind

Before everyone starts to get up, the scene starts with [[Xidon]] keeping watch by the Keep. He noticed a blue creature, bird like, working on something; in a friendly manner, Xidon goes up to him to introduce himself and take a look at what he is working on. 

As he gets closer, he notices how odd he seems here, an eccentric tinkerer, but no one else seems to mind him any attention. [[Xidon]] finally goes up to him and introduces himself and asks "What are you working on?". The blue, crow-like creature, [[Frostwind]], tells him he is working on a "narry" catcher - a tool that can help you land safely if you're falling from high up. [[Frostwind]] pleads [[Xidon]] to help him test his invention by climbing to the highest point of the Keep!

>[!warning] Xidon is Skeptical...
>When Xidon asked Frostwind what are the odds that this might work, he responded with "50/50". Upon hearing this, Xidon took safety measures and tied a rope around him before jumping off the 3 story building.

Good thing he did! Since the invention failed.

### The Next Morning

It's a beautiful morning! Everyone is out and about and a continental [[Ansalon]] breakfast is being served. We find [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] is up early sitting on a table and drinking some coffee at the [[Brass Crab]]. [[gigas]] is with him talking about mostly random things. Eventually, [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] does ask her if there was anyone that might have come down BEFORE him. Admittedly, [[gigas]] mentions that she did see [[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]] with one of the mercenaries from camp down here REALLY early/late. 

[[Weisslogia]] and [[Xidon]] eventually make their way out of their rooms and joins [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] at the table. 

>[!info] Grumm is Skeptical...
>Grumm seems to have a fundamental lack of understanding of magic...like most other people in this world. He seems mistrustful of anyone that does "magic".

As [[Elerion Windwalker]] walks into the room, he inconspicuously casts a spell on [[Lord Bakaris Jr]] to smell like a skunk. 

At some point, [[Radel]] walks in and gives us information on what the mercenary camp looks like. He estimates hundreds, maybe even close to 1,000 enemies! At hearing this news, the group is divided between finding a peaceful solution or going on the offensive...

[[Weisslogia]] and [[Xidon]] urge people to consider a peaceful solution, or at least a path to least bloodshed, while others like [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] and [[Lord Bakaris]] urge us to do something about this NOW.  Just then, [[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]] and [[Jeyev]] walk in and report on the scouting _they_ did; separate from the mercenary camp, they noticed a big military force north west of the village that seem too organized to simply be a mercenary band. Large hooded figures with what seem to be reptilian creatures underneath them. 

>[!warning] Weisslogia Knows the Danger
>When hearing this, Weisslogia immediately knows who this group is and the danger they pose to everyone here...

At this point, [[Weisslogia]] speaks up and is now urging the major that people need to evacuate while we attempt to deal with this foreign group. 

### At the Front Gate

When we make our way over to the front gate to investigate, we meet a messenger from the Red Army that has a letter for us....

> By the orders of [[Belephaion]], the Voice of [[Takhisis]] (Tiamat), you will quarter the soldiers of the invincible Red Dragon Army this night. Refuse and die. This is the Dragon Queen’s will.

The symbol on this messenger was a sort of a 5 colored star.

At this point, there was no doubt in [[Weisslogia]]'s mind. He knew exactly whose these were and was stunned. He knew we did not have enough of an army to go up against [[Tiamat]]...or [[Takhisis]] as she is known in this land. He knew that a surrender meant sure death. 

### Planning an Evacuation

When hearing of this from the messenger, we all agree and urge the major to retreat for now and plan for an evacuation of the city. We all realize and agree that if we let this army into our city, they will surely kill everyone. 

We notice that besides the water, there is only one way in and out of the city, which is the main gate - since the whole village is surrounded by cliffs and water. So most of our planning revolves around getting everyone out by boat. 

Everyone immediately starts to take on different tasks - 

- [[Weisslogia]] rings the town bell to announce to the entire village to get their belongings and meet back at the [[Brass Crab]] in a few hours for an emergency evacuation
- [[Xidon]] makes his way over to [[Frostwind]] to see if he is able to help with the evacuation in anyway
- [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] and [[Elerion Windwalker]] access the boat situation and attempt to convince the fisherman to help with providing more boats, enough to evacuation all ~400 citizens. 

Everyone is successful in their missions! Additionally, we know have workable narry catchers.

>[!info] Narry Catcher
>This backpack-sized device holds a balloon-based parachute. If you fall while wearing this device, you can use your reaction to deploy the parachute. Once deployed, the parachute rapidly inflates, and you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. When you are 10 feet away from the ground, roll a d20. If you roll a 5 or less, the parachute gives out, and you begin to fall normally, it is destroyed.

[[Xidon]] and [[Raven Uth Volger]] talk in private and ultimately exchange goodbyes. As the major of this wonderful city, [[Raven Uth Volger]] is incapable of simply retreating. She plans on staying here and fighting until her last dying breath, while everyone escapes to safety. [[Xidon]], although saddened by this news, understands and gives her a proper Solamnic salute. 

As we make progress, we notice that there are a few (4) enemy scouts that seem to be keeping an eye out on the outskirts of the city...perhaps an ambush. Fortunately, [[Xidon]] noticed this and are now taking the offensive and approaching them...

It looks like battle might be inevitable.

## Session 2 Summary
## Log

### Gloomy Day

- grimm morning
- [[Xidon]] has the first shift to keep a look out
- a little blue creature seems to be working on something...
	- looks like a big bird, like a crow
	- seems out of place, but no one seems to mind him
- [[Xidon]], very friendly, goes up to to this create and asks for his name and what he seems to be doing
	- hes a tinkerer
	- eccentric
	- working on a "nary" catcher, if you fall, you can catch yourself
- points to the top of the keep...to have [[Xidon]] try his invention. about 3 stories
- giant wooden contraption on top of keep and asks him if this is a good spot to jump from
- [[Xidon]] ties a rope to himself as a fail safe just in case...
- his name is [[Frostwind]]
>[!warning] Xidon Jumps
>Xidon jumps and the invention doesnt really work...so Frostwind is starting to climb up using his rope

- that ends his his shift...and its morning

### The Next Morning
- Continental [[Ansalon]] breakfast
- beautiful morning
- [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] wakes up early and is drinking some coffee downstairs in the [[Brass Crab]]
- [[gigas]] is there. Grumm mostly just listening to her
- asks if anyone came at night or before him
	- she mentions she saw [[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]] show up really early with one of the mercerneries from camp
- [[Weisslogia]] comes out and joins [[Grumm Stonebreaker]]
- [[Xidon]] makes his way as well

>[!info] Nods of Acknowledgement
>Grumm just nods to everyone instead of saying good morning...but does start talking to Xidon

- [[Elerion Windwalker]] walks into the room and casts a spell on [[Lord Bakaris Jr]] to smell like a skunk
	- "eww, whats with this guy, smells terrible"
- [[Radel]] giving us a brief of what the camp looks like
	- hundreds...maybe 1k enemies
- [[Grumm Stonebreaker]] is very adamant about going on the offensive, cant sit around and wait to be attacked
- [[Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile]] and [[Jeyev]] walk in...
	- during the scouting last night, they noticed a big military force north west of the village
	- too organized to just be mercernary bands
- [[Lord Bakaris]] is asking if we are going to do nothing about this?!?!

### At the Front Gate
- army is quickly approaching...
- heading to the River Gate
- messenger gets letter to [[Raven Uth Volger]]
	- People of Vogler,
By the orders of [[Belephaion]], the Voice of [[Takhisis]] (Tiamat), you will quarter the soldiers of the invincible Red Dragon Army this night. Refuse and die.
This is the Dragon Queenâ€™s will.

### Planning

- go back to the Inn to access the situation and possibly run away...
- we are all planning on different things...getting people out on boats and then hopefully figuring out how to get the other 200 people out of the city safely
- [[Weisslogia]] rings the bell and pleads with people to get their stuff and meet at the brass crab for further instructions on evacuating to safety
- Boat situation
	- [[Grumm Stonebreaker]]
		- convince fisherman give more ships
	- [[Elerion Windwalker]]
	- enough ships for about 200 ppl
	- repurpose ferry to get more ships
- [[Xidon]] talks with the mayor on who will take her place
	- there is a chest she has she entrusts [[Xidon]] with to give to [[Darret Highwater]]
- [[Xidon]] makes his way over to the keep to ask [[Frostwind]] if he can help
	- he rushes him to the top of the keep as soon as he gets there and wants to test the narry catcher
- frostwind comes up with a plan and will be building some more workable nary catchers

>[!error] 
>This backpack-sized device holds a balloon-based parachute. If you fall while wearing this device, you can use your reaction to deploy the parachute. Once deployed, the parachute rapidly inflates, and you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. When you are 10 feet away from the ground, roll a d20. If you roll a 5 or less, the parachute gives out, and you begin to fall normally, it is destroyed.

- there seems to be enemy scouts keeping an eye out for us
- we are going for them

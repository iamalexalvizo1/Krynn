## Session Summary

This session mostly revolved around a couple of things:
1. Logistics around the campaign (meeting times, length, house rules, etc)
2. Introduction to all of our characters

### Campaign Logistics

By now, many of us are pretty seasoned DnD players and have developed likes and dislikes. We went over things we would like to get out of the campaign (like more roleplaying opportunities) and things we _DON'T_ want (like back to back fights or long discussions of what we are going to do as characters). Going over some of these points are helpful reminders both to players and our DM so that everyone can contribute to the overall joy of playing a lengthy roleplaying game. 

Aside from going over a few things that were mentioned in our session 0 regarding the world of Krynn (like magic being a bit of a bohemian), we also went over a couple of exercises as a group of coming up with fictional places within this world for our DM to incorporate - specifically, fictional places that might mean something to our characters. They all sound very interesting and will call them out as they come up in the campaign! 

Finally, we went over a social contract of being kind and respectful to everyone in the group by showing up on time, supplying our schedules ahead of time, and other time related things to make planning 3 - 4 hour sessions as easy as possible around the schedules of 7 adults.

### Character Introductions

Here is a table of our in game characters with some basic information on them:

```dataview
table player as Player, race as Race, class as Class from "DnD/Krynn"
WHERE type = "PC"
SORT file.name ASC
```

The way our DM handled this was very cool - he gave each of us a scene of our own, in our own time and space, which will ultimately lead to everyone going to the same place - [[Ispen Greenshield]]'s funeral. This effort was made possible by us players giving our DM ahead of time a background on our character, with other NPC's, ideals, flaws, etc and then our DM stitching and weaving these multiple POV's together into something coherent. 

#### Xidon
We first find ourselves looking at [[Xidon]], traveling in the Salamnic region with another Knight, [[Ry]]. As they traveled and Xidon found himself longing for the days of when dragons return, the boy they were traveling with spots some hooded figures and ![[638046466583854974.png |200]] pops out and almost kills him!

Xidon seemed to have been carrying an important locket with him. 

#### Durin

We then cut scene and pan over [[Durin]], hanging out by a campfire. He seems to doze off or at least be in a dream like state where he is in a middle of a huge forest clearing and sees a fallen soldier's eyes open to show their bright silver color, before waking up. 

Upon waking up, Durin follows a trail made from the stuff he had around that leads all the way to a silver chain, with a silver triangle; it pulses divine energy ripples and creates a clearing (just like in his dream!) before vanishing. All of a sudden, there is a door frame that Durin goes through to come face to face with [[INSERT_NAME_HERE]], the platinum dragon that created this world. He wants Durin to bring him some "fire eyes" and gives him the amulet that had previously vanished - a connection to this dragon. 

#### Weisslogia

[[Weisslogia]] is sleeping in an elf camp, before being woken up by my friend, [[Drundi]] in a nervous rush. In the distance, there seems to be a ruckus of battle, fire, and people screaming. Everyone around me is packing up to leave immediately before trouble catches up to us - except for me. I rush down to the little village of [[Sylvanesti]], where an unknown 3rd party seems to be burning things down and tormenting the elf citizens. 

I wanted so badly to help a specific house where I heard a lot of pleas for help - but it was being pillaged by what seemed to have been 4 humans wearing red robes and a much bigger figure. Just as I was going to step out of the dark forests to help, Drundi catches up to me and stops me from making a foolish mistake and dying. All I could do was watch...before heading back to the elf camp I was traveling with...

#### Gideon and Elerion
[[Sir Gideon Blackwood]] and [[Elerion Windwalker]] are traveling together in a carriage to [[Vogler]]. Although both remain mostly quiet for most of the ride, Elerion attempts to talk with Gideon about joining his army against a darkness he is predicting - Gideon rejects the offer, for now. 

After traveling for a bit, they hear a noise and cry for help. At that moment, Gideon instinctively jumps out from where he was sitting to where the driver is, cuts the ropes to the horse, gets on it, and rides the horse to the source of the noice. He notices the following:

 ![[02-007.png | 300]]

A battle starts and ends with minor injuries to Gideon and Elerion.

#### Grumm Stonebreaker

We pan scenes to [[Grumm Stonebreaker]], he is also sitting around a campfire, sleeping. He dreams of a small and friendly lizard like creature. Grumm is intrigued more than anything else..."is it a dragon? no... it can't be.", he thinks to himself. 

He opens his eyes and sees a giant tail dash over the horizon with winds hard enough to flicker the flames of his campfire. An amulet he is carrying that has never done anything special in particular... is glowing all of a sudden. Upon closer examination, he notices someone is riding this big flying bird-like creature. 

After taking in what he just saw, he takes out the reason of why he is traveling in the first place and reads the following to himself:

- To the party and world, I am no dragonborn, but a elf.   
	- I go by Silvanas
	- Elf from Silvanesti - southeast forest of Ansalon
	- I chose this race of elf because it is closest to my skin color - light/silvery. 
	- I wear a hooded robe to hide most of my body and head (because of my horns), and wrap my arms and legs with a sort of bandage to cover my scales. I try my best to not show my hands or feet (because of the talons). 
	- I speak elvish since it was taught to me for my disguise (among other languages i am hoping to learn along the campaign).

Person of significance: Madame Mystique History: Old run down shop – just some super old lady running the place. It is full of trinkets and random different things from the past. Antiques and such.  
Fun Fact: Around 95% of things don’t work and are just junk but 5% are actual lost magic items that people have forgotten about and don't know how to use.

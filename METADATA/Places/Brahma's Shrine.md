Person of significance: My Grandpa History: An Old Shrine thought to have been destroyed paying homage to the grandfather of dragonborns. Training ground for young dragonborns. I was only there briefly as a young dragonborn, before events forced us out. Fun Fact: No one outside a select few in our dragonborn kind know of its existence. Though i am under the idea that it no longer exists.

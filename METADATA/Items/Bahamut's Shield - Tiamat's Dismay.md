## Ideas

- requires a dragonborn to be attuned to it
- grows with me... level 3, 5, 7
- base stats:
	- +2 AC
	- cause fear 1/day to chromatic dragons and their followers
- ![[Bahamut_holy_symbol Small.jpeg | 200]]
- the shield might look something like this as a base ^

>[!danger] Shield Evolution
>The shield will only evolve if I choose and stay on the path of redemption and am a lawful good creature Even after i chose this subclass, if the character bearing this shield strays from the path at any time, the shield might begin to reject the user. 

### 3rd Level Updates

> - becomes so heavy that I am unable to lift
> - etc
